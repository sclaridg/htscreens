README for CCLE dataset


***Expression***
CCLE expression data is quantified from RNAseq files using the GTEx pipelines. A detailed description of the pipelines and tool versions can be found here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/v9/TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md. We provide a subset of the data files outputted from this pipeline available on FireCloud. These are aligned to hg19.

RNAseq_transcripts - NumericalMatrix

Columns: transcripts


***Copy number***
The CN is called using Broad WES as top priority. If Broad WES is not yet available for a line, then Sanger WES data is used as long as the Sanger WES CN data correlates well with the Achilles log-fold change data. If the correlation is too low and the Sanger WES CN profile differs from the Broad Affy CN, then we used Broad Affy CN. If no WES data is available for a cell line, Broad Affy data is used. We plan to complete WES for all lines that do not have WES soon so we will phase out using Affy CN data. For the WES data, CN is called using a panel of normals that is female only. Therefore X CN is relative to 2 copies of X for WES data. We do not use the X chromosome CN data for cell lines where CN was derived from Affy arrays.


CCLE WES copy number data is generated by running the GATK copy number pipeline aligned to hg19. Tutorials and descriptions of this method can be found here https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11682, https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11683.


Post processing of the segmented level data addressed gaps and the ends of the called chromosomal regions.


segmented_cn - Table
Segment level copy number data
DepMap_ID
Chromosome
Start (bp start of the segment)
End (bp end of the segment)
Num_Probes (the number of targeting probes that make up this segment)
Segment_Mean (relative copy ratio for that segment)


gene_cn - NumericalMatrix
Gene level copy number data, log2 transformed with a pseudo count 1. This is generated by mapping genes onto the segment level calls.
Rows: cell lines (Broad IDs)
Columns: genes (HGNC symbol and Entrez ID)




***Fusions***
CCLE generates RNAseq based fusion calls using the STAR-Fusion pipeline. A comprehensive overview of how the STAR-Fusion pipeline works can be found here: https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki. We run STAR-Fusion version 1.2.0 using the plug-n-play resources available in the STAR-Fusion docs for gencode v19.


fusions - Table
Gene fusion data derived from RNAseq data. Data is filtered using the filters suggested by the star fusion docs. Column descriptions can be found in the STAR-Fusion wiki


***Mutations***
CCLE mutation calls are aggregated from several different sources and sequencing technologies. 


Currently, WES-based calls are generated on a quarterly basis using a cell line implementation of the CGA WES Characterization Pipeline (more info here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VO2kX_fgfUd0x3mBS9NjLUWGZu794WbTepBel3cBg08/edit). The cell line implementation of this pipeline has one key difference: because CCLE lines do not have a matched control sample, we use the same normal sample as a matched normal input for all samples using the same baits (Agilent vs. ICE). In addition, mutation calls still use hg19 alignment.


Quarterly WES-based mutation calls are added to the existing mutation calls from previous releases. WGS, Sanger WES, RNAseq, HC, and RD based calls from the 2nd phase of the CCLE project are also included. More details on how these mutations were called and filtered can be found in the manuscript “Next generation characterization of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia” in Nature.
